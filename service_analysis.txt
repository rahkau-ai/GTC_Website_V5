ISSUE ANALYSIS:
The homepage dropdown system has many more service entries than what appears on the services page because:
1. Multiple homepage dropdown entries can point to the SAME service on the services page
2. The homepage has different dropdown options for different audiences/interests, but they often link to the same underlying service
3. The services page shows actual distinct services, while homepage shows different "views" or "approaches" to those services

MISMATCH ISSUES TO FIX:
1. Service counts on services page summary cards may not reflect the variety of ways to access services from homepage
2. Some services referenced in homepage may not exist (need to verify all links work)
3. Cross-page navigation may not be working properly for all linked services
