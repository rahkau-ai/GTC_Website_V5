---

## CALL STRUCTURE (45-60 minutes)

### PHASE 1: TONE SETTING (2 minutes)

**Opening:**
"Thanks for taking the time. I've reviewed your background—really impressive experience in [specific area]. Here's how I'd like to use our time: I'll ask you some questions about where you are and where you want to go. Then I'll share what we do and see if there's a fit. If there is, great—we'll talk next steps. If not, that's totally fine too. Sound good?"

**Goal:** Set collaborative tone, remove pressure, establish authority.

---

---

### PHASE 3: VALUE PRESENTATION (15-20 minutes)

**Transition:**
"Got it. Based on what you've shared, let me show you how this works and see if it makes sense for your situation."

**Framework: Dream Outcome → Perceived Likelihood → Time Delay → Effort & Sacrifice**

#### 1. DREAM OUTCOME (What They Get)

"Here's what you're going to walk away with, whether you stay active or not:

**Consulting Skills:**
- Complete done-with-you training on client acquisition—how to identify prospects, position your services, have conversations that convert, and deliver results that get referrals
- You're not figuring this out alone. I'm showing you the exact system I use.

**AI Mastery:**
- How to safely use AI for consulting—research, content creation, client delivery
- Maintain professional standards and confidentiality while leveraging AI to work faster
- No technical background needed—I'll show you the tools and workflows

**Authority Building:**
- We create content around your expertise—interviews, articles, case studies
- Your knowledge gets published and promoted
- You become a recognized voice in [their specialty area]

**Revenue Sharing:**
- When projects need your specific expertise, you deliver and we split profits
- Fair compensation structure—I'll show you the numbers in a minute
- You're earning while you're learning

**Community:**
- Network of experienced gene therapy professionals
- Peer collaboration and knowledge sharing
- You're not isolated—you're part of a growing expert community

**Lifetime Flexibility:**
- Associated Member for life—you can leave and return anytime
- Find a great job? Congratulations. Want to come back later? Door's open.
- Complete control over your engagement level

Does this align with what you said you wanted—[reflect their stated goals]?"

*Wait for confirmation.*

#### 2. PERCEIVED LIKELIHOOD (Social Proof & Certainty)

"Now you might be thinking, 'Sounds great, but will this actually work for me?'

Here's why I'm confident:

**Your Expertise:**
You have [X years] in [specific area]. That's exactly what gene therapy developers need help with. Your knowledge directly removes avoidable hurdles—[give specific example: vector design mistakes, preclinical inefficiencies, CMC bottlenecks].

**The Training:**
This isn't theory. I've built this consultancy from scratch. I know what works because I do it every day. I'm teaching you the system I actually use—not some course I created.

**The Market Need:**
Gene therapy companies are making expensive mistakes in [their expertise area]. They need people who've been there, done that. You're not selling—you're helping them avoid problems you've already solved.

**The Structure:**
You're not alone trying to figure this out. Done-with-you means I'm in the trenches with you. You have questions? We talk. You're stuck? I help you unstuck.

Make sense?"

*Wait for confirmation.*

#### 3. TIME DELAY (Speed to Results)

"How fast can you see results?

**Week 1-2:** Onboarding, profile setup, initial training
**Week 3-4:** Start creating content, learn AI tools, positioning work
**Month 2-3:** First content published, client acquisition training in full swing
**Month 3-6:** First project opportunities, earning while building

Most partners start seeing their expertise valued and earning revenue within 3-6 months. Some faster, some slower—depends on your availability and how quickly projects match your expertise.

But here's the key: Even if you find a full-time job next month, you keep all the training, content, and skills. They're yours forever.

Does that timeline work for your situation?"

*Wait for confirmation.*

#### 4. EFFORT & SACRIFICE (What's Required)

"Now let me be straight about what this takes, because I only want partners who are serious:

**Time Commitment:**
- Initial training: Several hours per week for first 2-3 months
- Content creation: Post at least 2 times per week (LinkedIn, thought leadership)
- Knowledge capture: Participate in interviews, create case studies, help build lead magnets
- Project delivery: When clients come, you deliver quality work

This isn't passive. You're actively building something.

**Financial Investment:**
- Setup fee: $997
- This covers your training, onboarding, profile setup, and ongoing support

Now here's the key part—and why this is completely risk-free:

**100% Refund Guarantee:**
Your $997 is fully refunded when you:
1. Complete the training and content creation commitments (posting 2x/week, creating knowledge assets)
2. Deliver your first client project successfully

So if you do the work and deliver for one client, your net investment is $0.

You're essentially putting down a deposit that says 'I'm serious about this' and we're saying 'We're serious about your success.' When you prove commitment and deliver results, you get it all back.

What questions do you have about that?"

*Address any concerns.*

---

### PHASE 4: SOCIAL PROOF & HANDLING CONCERNS (5-10 minutes)

**If they express concern about investment:**

"I get it. $997 feels like real money. Let me put this in perspective:

**What consulting training programs cost:**
Professional consulting courses: $3,000-5,000
Business coaching: $2,000-10,000/month
Authority-building content services: $1,500-3,000

You're getting all of that for $997—and it's refundable.

**What you'll earn on your first project:**
Based on typical gene therapy consulting projects, you'll earn $3,000-10,000 on your first engagement. Plus you get your $997 back.

So your first project: $3,997-10,997 net profit, plus you have permanent consulting skills.

Does that math make sense?"

**If they express concern about time:**

"Fair concern. Here's how I think about it:

You're between roles right now [or semi-retired, or job hunting]. You have a rare window to learn something valuable without full-time pressure.

Option 1: Rush back into another job without learning consulting. If it doesn't work out, you're back to square one with no new options.

Option 2: Spend 3-6 months learning consulting skills that give you options forever. Whether you go back to full-time work or build a practice, you're more valuable.

The time you invest now creates optionality for life. Which option sounds better for your situation?"

**If they express concern about commitment:**

"That's exactly why we have lifetime membership. You're not locked in.

Find a great job next month? Fantastic—keep the skills, use them whenever.
Want to take a break? No problem—come back when you're ready.
Need to be inactive for a while? Your membership stays active.

This isn't a trap. It's a partnership that adapts to your life.

Does that address your concern?"

---

### PHASE 5: VALUE STACK SUMMARY (3-5 minutes)

"Let me summarize what you're getting:

**Skills & Training** (Value: $5,000+)
- Done-with-you consulting training
- Client acquisition system
- AI tools and safety protocols
- Authority building strategy

**Revenue Opportunities** (Value: Unlimited)
- Profit sharing on projects
- First project typically $3,000-10,000
- Ongoing revenue potential

**Community & Network** (Value: Priceless)
- Expert peer community
- Collaboration opportunities
- Lifetime membership

**Field Contribution** (Value: Legacy)
- Help remove barriers from life-saving therapies
- Your insights reach more developers
- Impact beyond any single role

**Total Value: $10,000+**

**Your Investment: $997**
**Your Net Investment After First Client: $0**

You're getting $10,000+ in training and support for a refundable $997 deposit.

And here's what makes this a no-brainer: You're learning skills that create options forever. Whether you consult full-time, part-time, or just have it as a backup plan—you're more valuable.

Does that make sense as a business decision?"

---

### PHASE 6: ASSUMPTIVE CLOSE (2-3 minutes)

**Don't ask "Do you want to do this?"**

**Instead, assume the sale and move to logistics:**

"Alright, based on everything we've talked about, I think there's a great fit here. Your expertise in [their area] is exactly what developers need to avoid [specific hurdles].

Here's what happens next:

**Step 1:** I'll send you the partnership agreement and terms—it outlines everything we discussed: the $997 investment, refund conditions, content commitments, and profit-sharing structure.

**Step 2:** Once you sign and submit payment, we schedule your onboarding call within 3-5 days.

**Step 3:** We start training immediately—I'll walk you through client acquisition, AI tools, and we'll begin capturing your expertise for content.

Sound good? Any questions before I send the agreement?"

*If they say yes:* "Perfect. I'll get that to you today. When you receive it, review it carefully. If anything is unclear, just email me. Once you're ready, sign and submit payment, and we'll get your onboarding scheduled."

*If they hesitate:* Move to Phase 7.

---

### PHASE 7: OBJECTION HANDLING (If Needed)

**Common Objections & Responses:**

#### "I need to think about it."

"Absolutely. Let me ask—what specifically do you need to think about? Is it the time commitment, the investment, or something else?"

*Get specific objection, then address it.*

"I appreciate you wanting to think it through. Here's my concern: You said your goal was [their stated goal] and that if you don't solve this, [their stated pain] gets worse. 

How long have you been dealing with this? [They'll say months/years]

So thinking about it hasn't solved it so far. What new information will you have tomorrow that you don't have now?

I'm asking because I want to make sure this is actually the right fit. If there's a real concern, let's address it now. But if this is about fear or uncertainty—those don't go away by waiting. They get worse.

What's really holding you back?"

#### "I need to talk to my spouse."

"Of course, that's important. Let me ask—what do you think their concern will be?"

*Get the concern, address it.*

"Here's what I'd suggest: Tell them you found a program that teaches consulting skills, builds authority, and creates side income—with a refundable $997 deposit. The worst case? You learn valuable skills. Best case? You build a revenue stream doing work you love.

Would they object to you investing in skills that create more options for your family?"

#### "I can't afford $997 right now."

"I appreciate your honesty. Let me ask—is it that you don't have $997, or that you're not sure this is the right use of $997?"

*If truly can't afford:*
"I understand. Here's the reality: If $997 is a difficult investment right now, then building income streams is probably even more important for you. This isn't an expense—it's an investment that gets refunded after your first client.

But I don't want you to be financially uncomfortable. If timing isn't right, let's stay connected. When you're in a position to invest in building consulting income, reach out."

*If not sure it's worth it:*
"So it's not about having the money—it's about whether this will work for you, right? Let me ask: On your first consulting project, you'll earn $3,000-10,000 minimum. Plus get your $997 back. That's 3-10X return.

If you knew for certain you'd earn $5,000 on your first project within 6 months, would you invest $997 today?"

#### "How do I know this will work for me?"

"You don't. And I can't guarantee it will.

Here's what I can guarantee:

1. I'll teach you the exact system I use to acquire clients
2. I'll show you how to position your expertise and charge appropriately
3. I'll help you create content that builds authority
4. I'll match you to projects that need your expertise
5. I'll support you through delivery of your first engagement

But you have to do the work. Post content. Participate in training. Deliver quality.

If you do those things, you'll succeed. If you don't, you won't—and no program will change that.

So the real question isn't 'Will this work?' It's 'Are you willing to do the work?'

Are you?"

---

### PHASE 8: FINAL CLOSE

**After addressing objections:**

"Look, here's the bottom line:

You have valuable expertise. Gene therapy developers need exactly what you know. There's real demand.

The question is: Do you want to learn how to leverage that expertise into consulting income, or do you want to keep wondering 'what if'?

You're between roles right now [or semi-retired, or building a practice]. You have a rare window to learn this without full-time pressure. Six months from now, that window might be closed.

I'm offering you:
- Proven training on client acquisition
- Done-with-you support so you're not alone
- AI tools that accelerate your work
- A community of peers navigating the same journey
- Revenue sharing on projects
- Lifetime flexibility to engage on your terms

All for a refundable $997 deposit.

The worst case? You invest 3-6 months, learn valuable skills, earn your money back on one project, and decide consulting isn't for you. You're no worse off—actually, you're better because you have new skills.

The best case? You build a consulting practice that gives you income, flexibility, impact, and options for the rest of your career.

So let's stop talking about it and actually do it. I'll send the agreement today. You sign, submit payment, and we start building this next week.

Make sense?"

**Then be silent. First person who talks loses.**

---

## POST-CALL

**If they say YES:**
- Send partnership agreement and payment link immediately
- Schedule tentative onboarding call
- Send welcome email with next steps

**If they say NO:**
- "No worries, this isn't for everyone. If your situation changes, feel free to reach out."
- Add to nurture sequence (monthly check-ins)
- Don't chase or pressure

**If they say MAYBE:**
- "I appreciate you considering this seriously. I'm going to send you the agreement anyway so you can review it. Take 48 hours to decide. If I don't hear from you by [specific date/time], I'll assume timing isn't right and I'll move on to other candidates. Fair enough?"
- Set calendar reminder for follow-up
- Don't extend deadline

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES (Hormozi Framework)

1. **Never pitch.** Ask questions, diagnose pain, prescribe solution.
2. **Assume the sale.** Don't ask "Do you want this?" Move to logistics.
3. **Address objections head-on.** Don't avoid concerns—tackle them directly.
4. **Use silence.** After closing statement, shut up. Let them process.
5. **Show confidence.** You're not begging. You're offering value. They need you as much as you need them.
6. **Make it their idea.** Reflect their words back: "You said you wanted [goal]. This does [goal]. So this makes sense for you, right?"
7. **Remove risk.** $997 refundable = $0 net investment after first client.
8. **Create urgency.** "Window of opportunity," "selective program," "limited spots" (if true).
9. **Be willing to walk away.** If they're not right, say so. Scarcity creates demand.

---

## DISQUALIFICATION TRIGGERS

**When to say NO:**

- They want passive income without work
- They're not willing to create content or share expertise
- They can't commit to at least 5-10 hours/week initially
- They're looking for guaranteed income immediately
- They have unrealistic expectations (expecting $100K in first month)
- They're not coachable or open to feedback
- They don't actually have 5+ years of relevant experience
- Their expertise doesn't align with any service area

**How to disqualify:**

"Based on what you've shared, I don't think this is the right fit for you right now. [Specific reason]. I'd hate for you to invest time and money into something that won't work. Let's stay connected, and if your situation changes, we can revisit."

**Why disqualify:** Bad partners waste your time, hurt your reputation, and prevent good partners from succeeding. Be selective.

---

## SCRIPT ADAPTATIONS

**For Semi-Retired Experts:**
- Emphasize: Legacy, impact, staying sharp, flexible engagement
- De-emphasize: Full-time income potential
- Add: "You've spent 30+ years building expertise. This lets you leverage it without full-time commitment."

**For Job Hunters:**
- Emphasize: Learn skills during downtime, earn while searching, enhance employability
- De-emphasize: Long-term consulting practice
- Add: "Whether you find a job or build a practice, you're more valuable with consulting skills."

**For Practice Builders:**
- Emphasize: Client acquisition training, positioning strategy, revenue potential
- De-emphasize: Lifetime flexibility (they're committed)
- Add: "This gives you the foundation to build a 6-figure consulting practice."

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Good Call:**
- They do 70% of the talking
- They articulate their own pain clearly
- They see the value without you having to oversell
- They have specific questions about logistics (not philosophy)
- They assume they're moving forward

**Bad Call:**
- You're doing 70% of the talking
- They're skeptical or combative
- They focus on price, not value
- They ask theoretical "what if" questions
- They're not engaged or taking notes

**If it's a bad call:** Disqualify quickly. Don't waste time on bad fits.

---

## FINAL MINDSET

You're not selling. You're diagnosing a problem and prescribing a solution.

If they have the problem and you have the solution, it's your ethical obligation to help them see the fit.

If they don't have the problem or won't do the work, it's your ethical obligation to not waste their time.

Be confident. Be direct. Be willing to walk away.

The right partners will say yes. The wrong ones won't. Both outcomes are success.
