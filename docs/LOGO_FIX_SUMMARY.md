**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Problem:
- All logos appeared **faded/washed out** with reduced opacity
- Company logos (CSL Behring, Evox, VeonGen) were **mixed with technology logos**
- Reduced contrast made logos less professional

### Solution:
1. ✅ **Increased opacity** from 60% → 100% for logo containers
2. ✅ **Increased opacity** from 85% → 100% for logo images
3. ✅ **Separated company logos** from technology logos into dedicated sections
4. ✅ **Maintained consistent scrolling speed** (30s) for both sections
